      <h2> Why this webpage? </h2>
    <p>This website was created in 2021, but I still made a retro page anyway. This is for my 1999 Bondi Blue iMac G3! Just know: I don't discriminate against a computer because of its age. All computers matter!</p>

    <h2> About me</h2>
    <p> I am from Australia, and love using a Macintosh. My favourite games are Doom & Quake. The graphics are amazing!</p>
    <br>
    <h2> Windows is evil! </h2>
    <p> Windows 95 is the reason why society is going downhill! Windows encompasses the vast majority of personal computers and is a plague that must be overcome. Choose compassion. Use a Macintosh and support Apple, a small company that works hard to make the mac great! Or, use gnu/linux!</p>
